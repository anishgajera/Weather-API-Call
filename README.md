# Weather - API Call with IRC Chatbot
This repository contains my Weather API call project. This program makes an API call to a weather server for a specific zip code which will be entered by the user to a ChatBot. Once entered, the program will recieve a JSON response from the call and parse the JSON string to obtain current weather data for the specified zip code.

Instructions:
1 - Open webchat.freenode.net
2 - Set the channel to #anishg
3 - Start the ChatBot
4 - run the program
